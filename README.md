## Instructions

If you've ever played the old Arcade game Frogger, this game will be very similar.
You, the player, have to navigate to the water without colliding with any of the
oncoming enemies: giant bugs! If you do collide with one of the bugs, the game
ends, and you have lost. However, if you manage to avoid the bugs and reach the
water at the opposite side of the playing field, you win!

To navigate, use the arrow keys to move up, down, left and right.

Move twice as fast by holding down the Shift key.

To load the game, open index.html in any browser window. 


Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
